            Finally, a project I can use! This software allows a user to upload
            footage of an amateur basketball game, and it will generate the
            corresponding box score for each player. The overall pipeline
            relies on some standard CNNs, YOLO models, useful heuristics, and
            a whole bunch of finetuning. There are so many interesting design
            decisions to discuss. I really loved this project if only
            because it allowed me to train fundamental skills in machine learning,
            AI, and project development while building something I care about.
            My main takeaway: we were living in the dark ages before Google Colab.

            My implementation of a virtual machine for the C0 programming
            language for 15-122 @CMU. Built in C, this VM executes C0 bytecode
            through a stack-based
            architecture, handling control flow, function calls,
            heap allocation, etc. Implementing instruction parsing, operand stack
            management, call stack frames, and runtime error handling, this is a
            true virtual machine capable of running arbitrary C0 bytecode
            programs. A deep dive into low-level systems programming and

            My final project for Intro CS @CMU. It being self-directed, I
            immediately knew I wanted to work with fractal geometry. So, I
            thought, no better way than to highlight the elegance and power of
            recursion in programming. After countless hours of sketching out
            trig problems, trying to learn photoshop, and polishing the UI with
            CMU Graphics, I put together a fun tool (and game) from which
            striking complexity can emerge. (Dec. 2024)

            My first ever Hackathon! Look at me slice those digital fruit. A
            rite of passage here at CMU, my 1st Place Hack112 experience was
            maximally awesome. Though going to bed at 6am (does that still
            count as going to bed?) is not exactly usual for me, smoothing out
            the interplay between OpenCV, Mediapipe, and CMU Graphics as my
            group members handled the game physics was well worth it. This was a
            great way for me to practice taking a project from an idea to
            deployment in just a short 16 hours. (Nov. 2024)

            This was my first full-scale computer science project. In short, I
            built a software to aid my high school's dance teacher. After
            ideation meetings and product proposals, we decided on a
            tool that could automate and aid his assessment of students
            attempting a historically tricky movement. Focusing on OpenCV,
            Mediapipe, and ChatGPT integration, I delivered a program that can
            analyze his students' dancing and provide accurate feedback on
            necessary improvements. (Feb. 2024)
