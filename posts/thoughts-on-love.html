          I recently finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186872335-somehow" target="_blank"><em>Somehow: Thoughts on Love</em></a> by Anne Lamott.
          The book was recommended to me by a good friend, in whose literary
          preferences I place much faith. Lamott's writing is pensive and
          glaringly honest, with a raw humor woven throughout that makes the
          read all the more personable. Some of Lamott's thoughts, frameworks
          for approaching life and love have stuck with me, and I wanted to
          discuss them here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Possibly Lamott's most poignant perspective is religion as amorphous,
          or possibly as polymorphous. Lamott recounts various periods of her
          life, including her struggle with alcoholism and her long,
          non-monotonic recovery from it. When she needed it most, the Church
          gave Lamott structure, accountability, togetherness, and the painful
          act of being loved. In this way Lamott was and continues to be
          prototypically religious: she teaches Sunday school; she prays and
          holds faith in the acts of God; and she attends service.
        </p>

        <p>
          Historically, I do not describe myself as religious. I am skeptical of
          the formalities and specifics of organized religion and instead tend
          to view belief systems as didactic narratives from which a
          semi-relevant moral framework can be extracted. I was therefore
          surprised to hear Lamott echoing a similar, albeit far more elegant,
          conceptualization of religion. On page 164, Lamott writes, "[My
          husband's] God expresses itself through music." It would be difficult
          to convey this point any more naturally. I see this as a functional
          approach to religion, one that does not necessarily deal away with but
          is agnostic of the structure of one's religion and chooses to
          celebrate its beauty and character. This quote asked that I pause and
          reflect, then, on if it is sensible to describe myself as
          non-religious. I no longer think it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Much of Lamott's writing reminded me of my grandmother. My grandmother
          served as a deacon for many years and has been devoted to her faith
          for the majority of her life; she has a profound network of beloved
          friends whom she has found through this. She is also similarly
          committed to radical love and evolution of the self. I have served as
          a dancer for 14 years. Many of the most important people in my life I
          have met and grown with through dance. I have learned to connect
          deeply with others, to contribute to a team whose whole is greater
          than its piecewise sum, to take correction and work like hell to
          improve, to regularly attend (a lot of) rehearsals, and to place faith
          in my teammates. I think that my grandmother, Lamott, and I would
          agree that dance is my religion.
        </p>

        <p>
          I find that this all contributes to a broader point Lamott makes about
          the necessity of community—a notion of faith is nonsensical in the
          absence of others. Lamott emphasizes that one's religion, be it dance,
          Christianity, or bird-watching, is only given body by community and
          purpose by how it impacts others. I am of the belief that America
          today is more individualistic than ever before and to its own

          >. Lamott experiences some approximation of this at the personal
          scale: "The lone wolf watching it all from a distance is such a
          romantic image, but he is actually the most vulnerable in the pack"
          (120). Here and throughout the book she discusses the difficulty of
          letting yourself be seen imperfectly by others, of the infinite value
          derived from connecting with a human that has conquered the same
          struggle or simply enjoys the same thing as you.

          I think Lamott would make an excellent Resident Advisor (RA). CMU has
          a culture of rigor, incessant hard work, and an unadulterated strive
          to maximize your individual marketability as a budding professional;
          as an RA for 20 first-year students, I make a monumental effort to
          implore my residents to do anything but this. I have dance rehearsals
          for 4-6 hours each week during the semester; taken together, these
          hours have been far more productive than the counterfactual homework
          sessions I could be doing. I walk out of rehearsal feeling
          rejuvenated, feeling full and healthy from having spent 2 hours in a
          room doing something I love with people I love. A key goal I aim to
          achieve as an RA is to convince my residents that life is about doing
          what you love, and if you do just that then all the rest will work
          out. I want my residents to honestly believe that it's worth joining
          <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/buggy/" target="_blank">Buggy</a>, even if it uses up 12 of your week's precious hours, that it's
          better to call with your hometown friends and play video games on
          Saturday instead of doing homework. Hell, I tell them to become an RA
          because it's a uniquely rewarding job and then pretend not to see
          their rolled eyes. I'm grateful for having read
          <em>Somehow: Thoughts on Love</em> if only because Lamott's words
          either engender or revitalize the (possibly holy) spirit of committing
          to yourself, to community, and to love.
