        <p>
          Before I talk about my experience here at CMU, be it courses or
          beyond, it's worth motivating why I want to do so in the first place.
          An adversarial reader might say "there are already
          <a href="https://fanpu.io/courses/" target="_blank">so<sup>1</sup></a>
          <a href="https://abigalekim.github.io/courses/" target="_blank"
            >many<sup>2</sup></a
          >
          <a href="https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/" target="_blank"
            >great<sup>3</sup></a
          >
          blogs just like this out there; we don't need another." This is fair,
          and indeed I could not readily respond until having sat with this for
          quite some time. My answer is brief: I believe that I have a unique
          perspective. In fact, most everyone does; I disagree with the premise
          of individuals' stories being mutually exclusive to the extent that
          they should not be shared.
        </p>

        <p>
          I walked into CMU with exactly 0 transfer credit, and an equivalent
          amount of competitive math (unless we're counting 3rd grade, in which
          case: touché) and programming experience. I hadn't even decided that I
          wanted to pursue a degree in STEM until the summer after my junior
          year of high school. Before then, I was planning on going to college
          for dance. While here, I've dedicated a significant portion of my time
          to parts of CMU that are definitively not classes. I will elaborate on
          all of this as it arises naturally, but I say it here to argue that my
          experience is qualitatively different from others, not better nor
          worse, and that my atypical background is perhaps a qualifier for a
          perspective worth reading. I hope that something I have to say is
          helpful.

            <h3>
              15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, David
              Kosbie
            </h3>
            <p>
              As a preface, this course changes considerably on a
              semester-by-semester basis. That being said, 15-112 is amazing.
              The average CMU first-year has an ever-increasing amount of prior
              CS experience from high school; I still think 15-112 is worth
              taking. Maybe 30% of the course content was "new" to me, but all
              of it was presented and tested to an extent that I had otherwise
              never experienced. You build an intuition for the most fundamental
              problem solving techniques and templates, which is far more
              powerful than the superficial internal fact lookup-tables with
              which most students leave high school. In later courses, I
              regularly find myself using a skill or habit that I built in
              15-112.
            </p>

            <p>
              The course itself is certainly difficult at times, especially if
              it is your first substantial exposure to CS. For those I know who
              struggled, the fast pace was the most common cause. The most
              important lesson I learned from this hardship is to use your
              resources. This is a major difference between university and high
              school. Courses at university extend well beyond the classroom.
              Especially for introductory courses like 15-112, there are many
              supplementary tools which you can leverage for your learning. My
              semester, we had small group meetings with TAs, recitations,
              advanced topic lectures, a hackathon, and more. This made me so
              excited to be here, and it should make you feel the same way. A
              love for learning is fundamental to who I am, and the notion of
              having such a robust pedagogical structure accessible to me was
              incredible. If nothing else, you get out what you put in: so put
              in everything.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also loved this course for Professor Kosbie. Kosbie wants to see
              his students not only succeed but do good in the world with their
              skills and positions of privilege. I had never heard a lecturer
              yell like him before; it was the perfect introduction to CMU. He
              brought a much-needed humility, personability, and no-bullshit-ery
              to each and every lecture. I vividly remember the last lecture of
              the semester, wherein, to summarize, he implored us for 80 minutes
              to start making positive change in the world right now, today. I
              couldn't help but sit there and smile. Kosbie was one of my first
              exposures to the incredible breed of person that you will meet
              time and time again at CMU, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
            </p>

            <h3>07-128 Freshman Immigration Course</h3>
            <p>
              FIC is a required course for all SCS first-years. CMU has an
              equivalent introductory course for every college. FIC is intended
              to teach you, functionally still a high schooler, the
              need-to-knows of life as a university student. In the CMU canon,
              FIC is a throwaway course to which students stop showing up after
              the first 2-3 weeks (if that long). While I empathize with the
              various motivations at play ((1) university is new and exciting
              and people want to do stuff that isn't lecture (2) the content
              isn't strictly academic and you can essentially look up all the
              information presented etc.), I claim that the lectures are worth
              attending.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, by virtue of sitting in lecture and some of the FIC
              assignments, you will meet other SCS students. This is far and
              away the best thing you can get out of university, especially CMU.
              My most formidable challenge during my first semester was
              constantly having my mind blown by the people around me. On a
              weekly basis, my pre-existing conception of what was possible for
              someone my age to accomplish was violently uprooted. This is so
              painfully healthy. The ability to be inspired by the people around
              you rather than demoralized is a muscle that requires training.
              University is about people. Life is about people. Frederick
              Buechner writes, "You can survive on your own; you can grow strong
              on your own; you can prevail on your own; but you cannot become
              human on your own." So, if you are going to skip FIC, at least do
              it to grab dinner with someone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Second, you have to drink the kool-aid. This is what one of my
              Orientation Counselors (OCs) would say during O-week, and it
              resonated with me. I mean that you have to embrace being a CMU
              student and everything that comes with it, that the only way to
              extract every ounce of value from CMU is to wholly throw yourself
              at every opportunity, every extracurricular, every lecture you
              come across. And CMU is way too damn expensive to not maximize
              your ROI. I believe that even something as trivial as not going to
              FIC, whether it's because you think the content is frivolous or
              because you're too busy or because you hate Veronica Peet, is an
              early step in the wrong direction, in a direction taking you away
              from being a committed participant in everything that's going on
              around you. Maybe you disagree, and that's okay.
            </p>

            <h3>07-131 Great Practical Ideas for Computer Scientists</h3>
            <p>
              Another SCS first-year-only course, GPI is designed to expose you
              to the "tools of the trade" on which you will rely heavily during
              your undergrad at CMU. While not officially required, most
              everyone takes GPI, and I am glad that I did. The course itself
              only asks ~3 hrs/week of work (for 2 units). I am generally
              skeptical of low-commitment ventures in that I tend not to get
              much out of them, but GPI only aims to give a wide survey of
              useful tools, and it does just that. Especially for me, someone
              who had never heard of typesetting, thought Linux had to do with
              Linus Tech Tips, and didn't know "shells" existed anywhere other
              than animals, this course was overwhelming in the best way. If you
              walk out of GPI even familiar with the names of major tools, I
              consider that a success.
            </p>

            <h3>21-120 Differential and Integral Calculus (Calc 1)</h3>
            <p>
              I took calc 1 my Sophomore year of high school. I'm (compared to
              the average person) good at math. This is probably why I got into
              CMU: mathematical maturity is a key predictor of success in SCS.
              21-120 was still hard. I got an 81/100 on the first midterm. This
              is a great grade in retrospect, but was certainly frightening in
              the moment: I got all A's in high school, and now I'm barely
              scraping a B… maybe I'm not cut out for this? I say this to
              emphasize that CMU is hard, and that the experienced difficulty is
              a byproduct of course rigor, which is teaching you a lot more than
              you learned in high school. Be okay with struggling, and be
              patient with yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
              An important pattern that I learned from 21-120 is that homeworks
              are (very) hard, and if you can do the homeworks then you can do
              the exams. High school math courses tend to assess a new topic by
              assigning 10-15 softball applications of the concept, then 1-2
              difficult generalizations of the concept. CMU assumes you will do
              the rote practice on your own and jumps straight to the
              difficulty. Being aware of this, ensuring that you actually do
              practice the basics, significantly demystifies coursework. I will
              also add that I started a habit of typesetting all my homeworks
              (when possible) in 21-120. I find it beneficial to do scratch work
              by hand then type up a formal submission in LaTeX. This (1) taught
              me LaTeX early on (2) allows me to disregard cleanliness when
              initially working through problems and (3) means I go over every
              problem at least twice (solving then typing), which is beneficial
              for deeply understanding content.
            </p>

            <h3>16-161 Artificial Intelligence and Humanity</h3>
            <p>
              This seminar was my favorite course during my first year. AI &
              Humanity broadly addresses the existential question of what it
              means to be human in an age of rapidly advancing machine
              intelligence. Coming into CMU, I had an existing passion for
              philosophical discussions surrounding AI; through this course I
              was able to refine my interest to AI safety, the field in which I
              now intend to spend my career. I strongly believe in the role that
              talent at places like CMU has in making significant positive
              change in the world. And not often enough are the technically
              greatest engineers deeply considering the safety and ethical
              obligations of their work.
            </p>

            <p>
              Exactly this is why I was so grateful for Professor Illah
              Nourbakhsh, Mickey McGlasson, and Mike Tasota who co-taught this
              course. Above all else, these three instilled in me a commitment
              to thoughtfulness, to being reasonable, and to thinking about the
              stakeholder, not the shareholder. Through a measured treatment of
              Čapek's <em>Rossum's Universal Robots</em>, Douglass's
              <em
                >Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American
                Slave</em
              >, Andreessen's <em>Techno-Optomist Manifesto</em>, environmental
              reports by Boston Consulting Group, and (much) more, I learned how
              to be a great engineer while being a great person. I should also
              mention that a benefit of incredible courses such as 16-161 is
              that they attract incredible students, who can serve as
              incomparable friends, mentors, teachers, students, all in one. And
              lastly, Prof. Nourbakhsh has got to be one of the coolest people
              in the world. Half the value of this course was hoping our
              discussions would get derailed by him regailing us with stories of
              his time at NASA working on Mars rovers, how he taught Sergey Brin
              and Larry Page at Stanford, or why he turned down an offer from
              Bell Labs. His intelligence and guidance was invaluable to me as a
              first-year.
