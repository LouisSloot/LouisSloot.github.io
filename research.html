              Frontier LLMs are evaluated on a large, standardized benchmark
              suite. In this suite, however, exists a crucial gap with respect
              to cybersecurity tasks, especially in mission-critical systems. As
              a current Research Fellow with SPAR, I work on the development of
              a cybersecurity benchmark that measures a frontier model's ability
              to detect and patch vulnerabilities in pivotal environments. This
              includes identifying and replicating real-world vulnerabilites,
              then writing automated penetration tests and leveraging an MCP
              framework to evaluate agent patches. My team and I are preparing
              our findings for ICML 2026.

              With the evergrowing impact of large single cell RNA-sequenced
              (scRNA-seq) datasets, effective methods for working with data at
              scale become only more pertinent. In this computational biology
              lab at CMU, my work as an undergraduate research assistant
              centered around improving identification of rare cell types in
              scRNA-seq datasets, relying on unsupervised machine learning
              techniques. Leveraging R for algorithm design and data analysis, I
              developed software to reliably cluster various cell populations,
              including gamma delta T cells, which are invaluable for cancer
              immunotherapy treatments.

              The OurCS research conference is an opportunity for undergrad
              students to make meaningful research contributions. In conjunction
              with two undergrad team members and working under a PhD Researcher
              in AI Optimization from Adobe, I trained, tested, and pruned a
              standard CNN in PyTorch to empirically locate optimal sparsity
              ratios that can balance performance and efficiency. We presented
              our findings to a panel of SCS faculty and conference personnel.
