          Hey, I'm <span style="color: #326d27">Louis</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You look great today! And welcome to my website. I'm currently a
          Sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science,
          majoring in Artificial Intelligence.
          I was born and raised in St. Paul, MN. I grew up spanning the gap
          between arts and school as best I could. From grades 1-11, I was a
          competitive dancer at a local studio <span><a id="dance-link 
          "href="dance.html" target="_blank"> (what?! dance?!)</a></span>, and I 
          took my senior year to pursue more professional performance 
          opportunites in the local arts scene. In school, I loved just about 
          everything thrown at me (but always a little extra with math); and 
          when I built my own gaming PC in 8th grade, I began my descent into 
          the wondrous world that is Computer Science. These days, I'm 
          especially intrigued, excited, and unnerved by AI. As such, I spend 
          much of my time consuming safety and alignment literature. I'd
          love to talk with you about that! Reach me easily here: <span><a

          (my photo) will stay here!
