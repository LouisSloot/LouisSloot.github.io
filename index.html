          Hey, I'm <span style="color: #326d27">Louis</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You look great today! And welcome to my website. I'm currently a
          freshman at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science.
          I was born and raised in St. Paul, MN. I grew up spanning the gap
          between arts and academia as best I could. From grades 1-11, I was a
          competitive dancer at a local studio, <span><a id="dance-link 
          "href="dance.html" target="_blank"> (what?! dance?!)</a></span> and I 
          took my senior year to pursue more professional performance 
          opportunites in the local arts scene. In school, I loved just about 
          everything thrown at me (but always a little extra with math); and 
          when I built my own gaming PC in 8th grade, I began my descent into 
          the wondrous world that is Computer Science. These days, I'm 
          especially intrigued, excited, and unnerved by AI. As such, I spend 
          much of my free time consuming safety and alignment literature. I've 
          most recently grown fascinated by Mechanistic Interpretability. I can 
          be reached easily at <span><a 
          href="mailto:lsloot@andrew.cmu.edu?subject=Coming From the Website">
          lsloot@andrew.cmu.edu</a></span>. Anyways, go and enjoy the website; I
          (my photo) will still be here!

            My final project for Intro CS @CMU. It being self-directed, I 
            immediately knew I wanted to work with fractal geometry. So, I 
            thought, no better way than to highlight the elegance and power of 
            recursion in programming. After countless hours of sketching out 
            trig problems, trying to learn photoshop, and polishing the UI with 
            CMU Graphics, I put together a fun tool (and game) from which 
            striking complexity can emerge. (Dec. 2024)

            My first ever Hackathon! Look at me slice those digital fruit. A 
            rite of passage here at CMU, my 1st Place Hack112 experience was 
            maximally awesome. Though going to bed at 6am (does that still 
            count as going to bed?) is not exactly usual for me, smoothing out 
            the interplay between OpenCV, Mediapipe, and CMU Graphics as my 
            group members handled the game physics was well worth it. This was a
            great way for me to practice taking a project from an idea to 
            deployment in just a short 16 hours. (Nov. 2024)

            This was my first true computer science project. In short, I
            developed a software to aid my high school's dance teacher. After
            several ideation meetings and product proposals, we decided on a
            software that could automate and aid his assessment of students
            attempting a historically tricky movement. Focusing on OpenCV, 
            Mediapipe, and ChatGPT integration, I delivered a program that can
            analyze his students' dancing and provide accurate feedback on
            necessary improvements. (Feb. 2024)

            The OurCS research conference is an opportunity for undergrad 
            students to make meaningful research contributions. In conjunction 
            with two undergrad team members and overseen by a PhD in AI 
            Optimization, I trained, tested, and pruned a standard CNN in 
            PyTorch to empirically locate optimal sparsity ratios that can
            balance performance and efficiency. We presented our findings
            to a panel of SCS faculty and conference personnel.
